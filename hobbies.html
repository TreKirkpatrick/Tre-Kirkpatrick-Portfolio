    <h1>Tre's Hobbies</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and participating in various sports. The teamwork and competitiveness inherent in sports are aspects that I truly value. Whether it’s shooting hoops at the local court or joining friendly matches with others, basketball keeps me active while allowing me to develop my skills.

        Beyond basketball, I love exploring the outdoors through hiking and nature walks. Being in nature helps me recharge and find balance in my busy life. I also enjoy following sports, whether it's watching games on TV or attending live events.
        
        Additionally, I have a passion for technology and frequently spend time learning about new web development trends and techniques. This hobby aligns well with my career aspirations and keeps me motivated to enhance my skills. Whether I’m on the court, hiking a new trail, or diving into coding, I’m always looking for ways to challenge myself and grow. </p>
